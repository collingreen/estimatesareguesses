        Wishful Thinking
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Everyone knows why having accurate project estimates would be valuable
        to a business; knowing when something will be done is like a crystal
        ball that would let the rest of the company run more smoothly in many
        different ways. Promises could be made to customers, teams could be
        perfectly balanced, performance could be objectively measured, and
        marketing could be scaled up just in time. Everything would be easier,
        faster, safer, and more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Unfortunately, this is all built on a fantasy that estimates are at
        least moderately accurate. Real work is messy in countless ways and
        even good-faith, well-informed, carefully-considered estimates tend to
        go wrong and when they do they can be wrong by incredible margins,
        often even by orders of magnitude.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Moreover, the act of giving estimates can often have an extremely
        negative effect on teams, especially dysfunctional ones that can’t fall
        back on a history of respect and trust.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">
        Why are estimates so inaccurate?
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Regularly being able to provide accurate estimates requires a huge
        amount of effort and discipline across an entire company plus the right
        kind of product at the right stage of its life. Almost no business is
        actually willing to shoulder this cost and the ones that do tend to
        work on things like satellites and fighter jets where the cost of long
        development cycles almost doesn’t matter compared to the cost of
        mistakes (and these also tend to overrun their estimates and budgets).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The reality of day-to-day work for the average software business,
        however, often makes an environment where accurate estimates aren’t
        even realistic.

            The reality in many disciplines is that you’ve never done the exact
            thing you’re estimating before, meaning there is always a level of
            uncertainty. This is especially true in software development since
            you’d simply use the existing code if you had written it already.

        Why do we keep doing it?
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Even after watching estimates be inaccurate over and over again most
        companies still insist on it (and don’t even try to address the issues
        above). Having something concrete, even if it might be wildly wrong,
        makes people feel like they understand more of what is happening,
        especially for work they don’t know how to do themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        If you assume good intentions from everyone involved then estimates,
        even rough and dangerously inaccurate ones, can at least provide
        something to use for making tradeoff decisions and a bit of structure
        that others can plan around.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        On the darker side, it is common to hear stories about managers asking
        for / insisting on / demanding estimates, often with assurances that
        they are ‘just rough estimates’, then throwing them back on the
        estimators like deadlines when things end up inevitably taking longer.
        Sometimes, especially when times are tough, it can feel like your
        coworkers and bosses only demand estimates from you so that you can be
        on the hook if things go wrong instead of them.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The sad truth is that many companies simply continue this process
        because it seems like the safe route since ‘everybody does it’.
        <a class="underline text-indigo-600 hover:text-gray-900" href="https://wiki.c2.com/?NobodyEverGotFiredForBuyingMicrosoft">
          Nobody gets fired for doing the normal thing</a>, even if it doesn’t work out
        well, while taking an overt risk like not requiring your teams to
        estimate projects can put your job at risk if it doesn’t deliver
        spectacular results.

      <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">
        The problems with "No Estimates"
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The "No Estimates" crowd have described the problems with estimation at
        great length. Allen Holub has
        <a class="underline text-indigo-600 hover:text-gray-900"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms"
        >a great keynote</a> about why effort put into detailed estimation is
        almost entirely wasted, both because it doesn’t increase accuracy and
        because all of the time spent on it could go into working on the actual
        product instead.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Eschewing estimates completely often seems like a dream for builders
        but requires an incredible culture of trust and communication in order
        to not be a huge thorn in the side of the rest of the business. Even
        then, in order for things to run smoothly, a team with no estimation
        process requires a very stable project to work on plus consistent,
        experienced makers who have a good understanding of everything that
        needs to change or be added. Brand new projects or brand new teams are
        often too volatile to generate a steady flow of the right work, which
        is what makes it possible for the rest of the people involved to deal
        with not having any estimates.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">
        Giving project estimates can have a silver lining
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Even though the quest for an accurate estimate is a futile one, there
        is still a lot of value that can be gained from the estimation process
        while avoiding the worst of the downsides. “No Estimates” can be very
        cool in the right environment with the right project, but it loses out
        on the very valuable data we actually <em>can</em> derive from the estimation
        process itself.

            Estimating as a team can provide opportunities for the estimators
            to learn from each other, especially when discussing system design

        If you are forced to provide estimates for a project, make sure you’re

        Best of both worlds?
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        There are a plethora of project management techniques out there that
        try to make estimating more accurate or less painful, but the one I’ve
        found to be the most helpful in my own work is a bastardized version of
        <a class="underline text-indigo-600 hover:text-gray-900"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_estimation"
        >"3 point estimation"</a> specifically designed to avoid the list of
        bad things discussed above while maximizing the secondary benefits. By
        embracing the fact that estimates cannot and will not be accurate we
        can get rid of the toxic parts and expose the good bits underneath.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The goal is to get quick, casual guesses from each team member for an
        absurdly optimistic date and an unreasonably pessimistic date. Making
        them explicitly unreasonable and calling them guesses helps take the
        pressure off of giving them and reduces the worry that someone will
        treat them like actual estimates. The team should be able to give them
        within a minute or two; if they can’t then your project plan isn’t
        clear enough and you should go work on that with the team until it is.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Having both the too-early and too-late guesses also makes it easier to
        get useful insights than just having a single date. The guesses over
        time are useful on their own but looking at the difference across the
        team for each type of guess can highlight places that the team needs to
        better understand (or agree upon). Most importantly, measuring the
        range between the optimistic and pessimistic dates is probably the best
        single indicator for general project health that you can get. If the
        gap is shrinking faster than time is passing you’re on the right track.
        If it stays level, you’re failing to make progress. If it expands, you
        don’t have a viable project plan and need to go make serious changes
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
        Implementing this is intentionally simple:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        First of all, explain this entire plan to the team. Explain that these
        are guesses, that they should be made quickly and with no stress, and
        that they are explicitly designed so they can’t be turned into
        deadlines. Reassure the entire team that you know it is impossible to
        accurately guess when the project will ship but that by tracking these
        guesses over time you can get some useful insight into how the work is
        going and, more importantly, early warning signs if something is going
        wrong.

                a major system was missed, a team member leaves, production
                constantly goes down. The only requirement here is being really
                confident that the real ship date, whatever that is, will be
                sometime before this pessimistic guess.

          <span>
            Look at the estimates as a whole and use your brain; consider what
            each metric means and if it should be going up or down over time.
            When you see something off, spend the effort to figure out the
            cause. Think about things like the following:

            <ol role="list" class="ml-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <span

                >
                  -
                </span>
                  The average difference between the optimistic and the
                  pessimistic guess is a rough gauge for the team’s uncertainty
                  about the plan. This should go down quickly over time.

              </li>
              <li>
                <span
                  class="h-5 w-5 flex-none"

                >
                  -
                </span>
                  The difference between each of the optimistic guesses or the
                  pessimistic guesses can illuminate when the team doesn’t
                  agree on the plan. Explore this and you might find a
                  shorter path forward but more likely you’ll find a landmine
                  you weren’t expecting (but hopefully before it explodes).

              <li>

                  Sudden spikes in someone’s pessimistic guesses are a waving
                  red flag that something changed - it might be in your project
                  or completely unrelated but you should find out what you can
                  as quickly as possible.

                </span>
                  If you make guesses every week and the pessimistic guesses
                  always push back about a week then you’re making literally
                  zero progress. You should consider the project severely at
                  risk until something changes.
              </li>

                  Estimators are reluctant to move back their pessimistic
                  guesses by much each time, even if they should. This is one
                  of the same reasons that normal estimates are so inaccurate.
                  There probably isn’t a way to fix this but consider changes
                  in the pessimistic guesses with more weight than changes to
                  the optimistic ones.

        Like pretty much everything in life, this works better for some teams
        than others and your mileage may vary. If this resonates with you and
        your team and you think you can get a lot of value from the steps laid
        out above without too much downside from not having estimates (even bad
        ones) then try it out! If not, figure out what problems your team
        really has and come up with a coherent solution for your situation
        instead.
